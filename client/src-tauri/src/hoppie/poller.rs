///
/// - **Telex/undecodable entries.** First version sorted them as "reply
///   owed" (`true`) on the theory that they'd then just stay put
///   relative to instructions — wrong: a stable sort by a two-valued key
///   only preserves order *within* a key group, so a telex that arrived
///   BEFORE an NE/N message still gets pulled to AFTER it (both are just
///   "the `true` group" and "the `false` group" — the telex's true
///   original position is not part of the key at all). We have no
///   response-requirement code to judge telex or an undecodable packet
///   by, so rather than guess, leave the whole batch alone.
/// - **A handover directive anywhere in the batch.** Unlike every other
///   uplink here, handling a `HANDOVER <station>` message has real side
///   effects beyond the message log — see `poll_once`'s handover arm:
///   it flips `to_station`, marks the thread logged off, and fires a
///   new `REQUEST LOGON`, all synchronously, before the loop moves on to
///   the next envelope. `HANDOVER` itself typically carries a no-reply
///   code, so without this guard it would be a candidate for being
///   pulled EARLIER in the batch by the very sort this function does —
///   changing not just what the pilot sees but the actual order those
///   side effects run in relative to whatever else was in the batch.
///   That risk costs nothing to close (batches mixing a handover with
///   another uplink are already rare), so it's excluded outright rather
