//! MSFS 2020 / MSFS 2024 simulator adapter — **raw SimConnect FFI**.
//!
//! See ADR-0002 in `docs/decisions/0002-msfs-simconnect-only.md`.
//!
//! Reference docs:
//! <https://docs.flightsimulator.com/msfs2024/html/6_Programming_APIs/SimConnect/SimConnect_SDK.htm>
//!
//! # Why raw FFI
//!
//! We previously used the third-party `simconnect-sdk` crate (archived
//! 2026-02-22). Its `SimConnectObject` derive macro builds one big
//! `#[repr(C, packed)]` struct from your fields and registers them
//! with `SimConnect_AddToDataDefinition` in field order. The fatal
//! quirk: when SimConnect rejects a single SimVar (because the
//! aircraft doesn't define it, or the SimVar moved/got renamed),
//! the rejection is delivered **asynchronously** via
//! `SIMCONNECT_RECV_EXCEPTION`. The crate does not surface those
//! exceptions, so the local struct still expects N fields but the
//! sim only sends N-1 — and every subsequent read shifts up,
//! producing memory-aligned garbage (we observed this with
//! `PLANE TOUCHDOWN *`, `FUELSYSTEM TANK WEIGHT:N` and FBW LVars).
//!
//! In raw FFI we:
//!   * drive `SimConnect_AddToDataDefinition` per SimVar with explicit
//!     HRESULT checks;
//!   * surface `SIMCONNECT_RECV_EXCEPTION` to the tracing log so the
//!     pilot/dev can see *which* SimVar got rejected;
//!   * parse the data block byte-by-byte at fixed offsets so a
//!     dropped SimVar can never corrupt another field.
//!
//! Status: minimal port (Phase L). Position, attitude, speeds,
//! fuel & weight (with EX1 SimVars), aircraft identity, on-ground.
//! Lights / AP / addon-specific LVars get re-added on top of this
//! foundation incrementally.
